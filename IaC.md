# What is IaC in DevOps?
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to managing data center server, storage, and networking infrastructure. IaC is meant to significantly simplify large-scale configuration and management.

# Benefits of IaC?
- Improved productivity. Administrators and operators no longer must perform manual configuration steps for data center infrastructure changes.
- Improved reliability. The configuration of the infrastructure is contained in electronic files, and software is responsible for initiating infrastructure changes, so there is less chance of human error.

# What do we mean by configuaration managment
- Configuration Management is the process of maintaining systems, such as computer hardware and software, in a desired state. Configuration Management (CM) is also a method of ensuring that systems perform in a manner consistent with expectations over time.

# What is orchestration in DevOps
- Orchestration is the automated configuration, management, and coordination of computer systems, applications, and services. Orchestration helps IT to more easily manage complex tasks and workflows.
