## What is cloud computing?
- Cloud computing is a model of delivering on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, including servers, storage, databases, applications, and services, over the internet. Rather than storing and processing data on a local server or personal computer, cloud computing allows individuals and businesses to use computing resources provided by a third-party provider on a pay-as-you-go basis. This enables greater scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency, as users can quickly and easily access additional computing resources as needed without having to invest in and manage their own physical infrastructure. Some examples of cloud computing services include cloud storage, software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

## Saas? 
- SaaS stands for "Software as a Service," and it is a cloud computing model in which software applications are delivered to users over the internet. With SaaS, the software is hosted on a cloud provider's infrastructure and made available to users through a web browser or a dedicated application.
## Paas
- PaaS stands for "Platform as a Service," and it is a cloud computing model in which a provider offers a platform for building, deploying, and managing software applications over the internet.
## Iaas
- IaaS stands for "Infrastructure as a Service," and it is a cloud computing model in which a provider offers virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking.
