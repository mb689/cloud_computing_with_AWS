## STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO LAUNCH AWS INSTANCE
```
Sign in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
Click on the "Launch Instance" button.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for your instance. This will depend on the operating system and software you want to run on your instance.
Choose an Instance Type. This determines the amount of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity that your instance will have.
Configure the Instance Details. You can choose the number of instances to launch, specify network settings, and add user data scripts.
Add storage. You can add Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes or Instance Store volumes to your instance.
Configure Security Group. This is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to your instance.
Review your instance details and click "Launch" to start your instance.
Choose a key pair. This is used to encrypt login information and connect to your instance. You can choose an existing key pair or create a new one.
Wait for the instance to start. This may take a few minutes.
Once the instance is running, connect to it using Remote Desktop (for Windows instances) or SSH (for Linux instances). You can also use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to connect to your instance without requiring an open port.
That's it! You have now successfully deployed an AWS EC2 instance.
